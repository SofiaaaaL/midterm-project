          <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine">Guangdong/Cantonese Cuisine</a></h4>
          <p>- Chinese: 粤菜 Yuècài</p>
          <p>- Sweeter, favoring braising and stewing, adding various mild sauces</p>
          <br>
          <p>Cantonese food is the most popular style internationally. Guangdong Province and Hong Kong are noted for <strong>fine seafood dishes and rice dishes</strong>.</p>
          <p>They eat a very wide variety of foods. The dishes they serve don't have strong flavors since it is lightly seasoned, and they often tend to be a little sweet.</p>
          <p>An authentic Cantonese chef's goal is to preserve the food's original flavor. Unlike other Chinese styles of cooking such as Sichuan style where the cook buries the food in a lot of spices and oil, a Cantonese chef aims to bring out or highlight the original flavor of the vegetable, meat, or fruit. So little spice or sugar is used generally.</p>

          <p>- Chinese: 川菜 Chuāncài</p>
          <p>- Spicy and bold, often mouth-numbing, using lots of chili, garlic, ginger, and peanuts</p>
          <br>
          <p>Sichuan Province produced the most widely served cuisine in China. Their dishes are famous for their hot-spicy taste and the numbing flavor of Sichuan peppercorn that is rare in other regional cuisines. It is the food of Chengdu and Chongqing (which used to be part of Sichuan).</p>
          <p>Sichuan cuisine holds a reputation for its variety of seasonings used, as each dish requires different cooking methods. As the saying goes, 'one dish with one flavor, with one hundred dishes come hundred flavors.'</p>
          <p>Sichuan food is most well-known for its hot and spicy flavor, though it may sport sweet and sour flavors too. The most commonly used spices you can find in most households and eateries are "The Five Fragrances" which consist of fennel, pepper, aniseed, cinnamon, and clove; chili and Sichuan pepper.</p>

          <p>- Chinese: 苏菜 Sūcài</p>
          <p>- Fresh, moderately salty and sweet, precise cooking techniques, favoring seafood, soups and artistic, colorful presentation</p>
          <br>
          <p>Jiangsu Province and China's biggest city, Shanghai, have a very refined gourmet cuisine that is often served at government banquets.</p>
          <p>What makes it special is the exquisite cooking techniques that produce richly aromatic and visually artistic dishes. Their chefs also focus on serving meals that promote health.</p>
          <p>Their chefs emphasize bringing out the distinct natural flavors in the rich range of meat and plant ingredients in their dishes. So they don't add much salt, sugar or seasonings like chili powder that hide and overwhelm the ingredients' flavors. So their meals are richly aromatic.</p>

          <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_cuisine">Zhejiang Cuisine</a></h4>
          <p>- Chinese: 浙菜 Zhècài</p>
          <p>- Mellow, using fresh seafood, freshwater fish, and bamboo shoots, and a wide variety of cooking methods.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Zhejiang Cuisine originates from the populous and rich eastern province of Zhejiang on the Pacific. If you don't like spicy cuisine, but prefer fish and seafood, then this is the food style for you. </p>
          <p>Hangzhou, its capital, was the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, and the city was renowned for their wealth and sophistication. Maybe this is why the food is unusually dainty and refined. </p>
          <p>They focus less on colorful dishes and artistry than the Fujianese do and focus more on serving fresh food. The food is often served raw or almost raw and is fresh and crispy and seasonal. It is more like Japanese food in this way.</p>

          <p>- Chinese: 闽菜 Mǐncài</p>
          <p>- Lighter, with a mild sweet and sour taste, using ingredients from the sea and the mountains</p>
          <br>
          <p>Fujian Province is known for great seafood and soups and the precise use of scintillating but not tongue numbing spices. </p>
          <p>Their cuisine is known for the use of exotic delicacies from the mountains and sea as the main ingredients, an emphasis on soup eating, precisely applying various kinds of seasonings, and an emphasis on artistically cutting and decorating food.</p>
          <p>Fujian's abundant natural resources mean that their cuisine is rich in quality nutritious ingredients. They'll use somewhat exotic ingredients such as wild foods, wild herbs, varieties of mushrooms, bamboo, and many kinds of seafoods. So it is nutritious, and it is good for dieters since it isn't high calorie.</p>

          <p>- Chinese: 湘菜 Xiāngcài</p>
          <p>- Quite spicy, with a hot and sour taste, favoring sautéing, stir-frying, steaming and smoking</p>
          <br>
          <p>If you like Sichuan food, you'll probably like Hunan food too since it is even hotter. It is tastier and more delicious because they don't use peppercorn that numbs the mouth. </p>
          <p>The Sichuanese use pepper corn that numbs your mouth so the food all starts tasting the same. Instead, the Hunanese use vinegar with the pepper. It serves to stimulate the taste buds and make them tingle, so you can better perceive the wide range of flavors and the rich variety of ingredients and spices.</p>
          <p>The many different tastes of the food partly stems from an unusually wide variety of agricultural products. Several kinds of chili peppers are grown. Citrus fruits are one of the major crops, and it lends the yummy sour flavor to dishes such as the popular Hunan Orange Chicken.</p>

          <h4><a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/chinese-food/hui-cuisine.htm">Anhui  Cuisine</a></h4>
          <p>- Chinese: 徽菜 Huīcài</p>
          <p>- Uses many wild plants and animals as ingredients, favoring stewing and more oil</p>
          <br>
          <p>Anhui cuisine is even wilder than Fujian cuisine. It is inland, and big mountains such as the Yellow Mountains are the source of lots of different wild foods and herbs. It is basically a hearty mountain peasant food. Some of the best dishes incorporate wild food for an unusual taste. Some dishes are sweet from added sugar.</p>
          <p>Huizhou cuisine is one of the eight major food styles of China. It is unique and famous. Hui cuisine originated from the Qin (221 BC to 207 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) dynasties, prospered in the Tang (618 AD to 907 AD) and Song (960 AD to 1279 AD) dynasties, flourished in the Ming (1368 AD to 1644 AD) and Qing (1644 AD to 1912 AD) dynasties, and reached its peak in the middle and late Qing Dynasty.</p>
          <p>Both wild and cultivated fungi and mushrooms are relished as flavorings and for their nutritional value.</p>

          <p>- Chinese: 鲁菜 Lǔcài</p>
          <p>- Salty and crispy, favoring braising and seafood</p>
          <br>
          <p>Shandong was one of the first civilized regions in China and an early cultural center, so its cooking tradition set the style for the regions around it, especially to the north in Beijing and northeastern China. </p>
          <p>Now Shandong cuisine is relished for the many kinds of different seafood and vegetable dishes and their style of frying in high heat that locks in the flavors and isn't oily.</p>
          <p>They preserve the original taste of the seafood by using simple ingredients and braising, and they like vinegar and salt. Unlike southern cuisines, they serve much more wheat food, including their noodles. </p>
