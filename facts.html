              <p>Food Is Superstitiously Symbolic</p>
              <p>Chinese attach particular meanings to certain foods based on shapes, colors, pronunciations, and legends. Superstition and tradition dictate certain foods must be eaten for certain festivals/events to invoke a blessing.</p>
              <p>For example, ingot-shaped dumplings mean wealth at New Year, and round mooncakes represent family reunion at Mid-Autumn. </p>

              <p>China's North/South (Wheat/Rice) Food Divide</p>
              <p>The colder, drier north favors wheat production, so northerners eat dumplings, wheat noodles, steamed buns, and stuffed buns mostly.</p>
              <p>In the south, Chinese eat bowls of rice or rice noodles with almost every meal (as well as far greater varieties of fruit and veg), and only occasionally eat wheat.</p>

              <p>The Healthiest Food Around the World</p>
              <p>Chinese like fresh ingredients and always try to achieve a balanced portion of vegetables and meat, to provide all nutrition the body needs. </p>
              <p> Some healthy cooking methods, such as steaming and boiling, destroy
                 the nutrition in the ingredients to the least extent.</p>
              <p>Some herbal medicine is adopted to make dishes with medicinal functions, such as jujube and ginseng.</p>

              <p>Overseas Chinese Food - Localized</p>
              <p>One of the most important Chinese food facts you need to know is that Chinese food in the foreign countries has been adapted to local flavors. </p>
              <p>General Tso's Chicken and Stewed Chicken with Orange Sauce, very popular in America, are not traditional Chinese dishes. Even many Chinese may not know about that.</p>

              <p>Confusing Dishes Names</p>
              <p>The names of some dishes may have nothing to do with their ingredients or cooking methods, which is a strange Chinese food fact for foreigners. </p>
              <p> They are for auspicious purposes or named after a moving story or based on their appearance. For example, the Chilli Fish Head is also called “hong yun dang tou” which means good luck; Vermicelli with Spicy Minced Pork is known as “ants climbing the tree” in China for it just looks like that.</p>
